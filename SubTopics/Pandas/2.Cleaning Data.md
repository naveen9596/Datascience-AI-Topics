## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.

Bad data could be:
```
1.Empty cells
2.Data in wrong format
3.Wrong data
4.Duplicates
```

## Take any Data Set

The data set contains some empty cells 

The data set contains wrong format. 

The data set contains wrong data.

The data set contains duplicates.

### Pandas Cleaning Empty Cells:
## Empty Cells
Empty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.

## Remove Rows
One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells.

This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result.

**Example**
``` python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

new_df = df.dropna()

print(new_df.to_string())

```
Note: By default, the dropna() method returns a new DataFrame, and will not change the original.

If you want to change the original DataFrame, use the **inplace = True** argument:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.dropna(inplace = True)

print(df.to_string())
```

**Note:** Now, the dropna(inplace = True) will NOT return a new DataFrame, but it will remove all rows containing NULL values from the original DataFrame.
