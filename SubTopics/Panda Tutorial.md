## Pandas
Pandas is arguably the most important Python package for data analysis. With over 100 million downloads per month, it is the de facto standard package for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis. Its ability to read from and write to an extensive list of formats makes it a versatile tool for data science practitioners. Its data manipulation functions make it a highly accessible and practical tool for aggregating, analyzing, and cleaning data. 

In our blog post on how to learn pandas, we discussed the learning path you may take to master this package. This beginner-friendly tutorial will cover all the basic concepts and illustrate pandas' different functions. You can also check out our course on pandas Foundations for further details. 

This article is aimed at beginners with basic knowledge of Python and no prior experience with pandas to help you get started.

### What is pandas?
pandas is a data manipulation package in Python for tabular data. That is, data in the form of rows and columns, also known as DataFrames. Intuitively, you can think of a DataFrame as an Excel sheet. 

pandasâ€™ functionality includes data transformations, like sorting rows and taking subsets, to calculating summary statistics such as the mean, reshaping DataFrames, and joining DataFrames together. pandas works well with other popular Python data science packages, often called the PyData ecosystem, including

### 1. NumPy for numerical computing
### 2. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other data visualization packages
### 3. scikit-learn for machine learning

## What is pandas used for?
pandas is used throughout the data analysis workflow. With pandas, you can:

Import datasets from databases, spreadsheets, comma-separated values (CSV) files, and more.
Clean datasets, for example, by dealing with missing values.
Tidy datasets by reshaping their structure into a suitable format for analysis.
Aggregate data by calculating summary statistics such as the mean of columns, correlation between them, and more.
Visualize datasets and uncover insights.
pandas also contains functionality for time series analysis and analyzing text data.

### Key benefits of the pandas package
Undoubtedly, pandas is a powerful data manipulation tool packaged with several benefits, including:

Made for Python: Python is the world's most popular language for machine learning and data science.
Less verbose per unit operations: Code written in pandas is less verbose, requiring fewer lines of code to get the desired output. 
Intuitive view of data: pandas offers exceptionally intuitive data representation that facilitates easier data understanding and analysis.
Extensive feature set: It supports an extensive set of operations from exploratory data analysis, dealing with missing values, calculating statistics, visualizing univariate and bivariate data, and much more.
Works with large data: pandas handles large data sets with ease. It offers speed and efficiency while working with datasets of the order of millions of records and hundreds of columns, depending on the machine.

## Install pandas
Installing pandas is straightforward; just use the pip install command in your terminal. 
```python
pip install pandas
```

## Importing data in pandas
To begin working with pandas, import the pandas Python package as shown below. When importing pandas, the most common alias for pandas is pd.

```python
import pandas as pd
```
Use read_csv() with the path to the CSV file to read a comma-separated values file

```python
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")
```

This read operation loads the CSV file diabetes.csv to generate a pandas Dataframe object df.

### Importing text files

Reading text files is similar to CSV files. The only nuance is that you need to specify a separator with the sep argument, as shown below. The separator argument refers to the symbol used to separate rows in a DataFrame. Comma (sep = ","), whitespace(sep = "\s"), tab (sep = "\t"), and colon(sep = ":") are the commonly used separators. Here \s represents a single white space character.


```python
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.txt", sep="\s")
```
### Importing Excel files (single sheet)
Reading excel files (both XLS and XLSX) is as easy as the read_excel() function, using the file path as an input.
```python
df = pd.read_excel('diabetes.xlsx')
```
You can also specify other arguments, such as header for to specify which row becomes the DataFrame's header. It has a default value of 0, which denotes the first row as headers or column names. You can also specify column names as a list in the names argument. The index_col (default is None) argument can be used if the file contains a row index.

### Importing Excel files (multiple sheets)
Reading Excel files with multiple sheets is not that different. You just need to specify one additional argument, sheet_name, where you can either pass a string for the sheet name or an integer for the sheet position (note that Python uses 0-indexing, where the first sheet can be accessed with sheet_name = 0)

```python
# Extracting the second sheet since Python uses 0-indexing
df = pd.read_excel('diabetes_multi.xlsx', sheet_name=1)
```

### Importing JSON file
Similar to the read_csv() function, you can use read_json() for JSON file types with the JSON file name as the argument. The below code reads a JSON file from disk and creates a DataFrame object df.

```python
df = pd.read_json("diabetes.json")
```
## Outputting data in pandas
Just as pandas can import data from various file types, it also allows you to export data into various formats. This happens especially when data is transformed using pandas and needs to be saved locally on your machine. Below is how to output pandas DataFrames into various formats.
