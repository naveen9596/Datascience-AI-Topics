## Pandas
Pandas is arguably the most important Python package for data analysis. With over 100 million downloads per month, it is the de facto standard package for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis. Its ability to read from and write to an extensive list of formats makes it a versatile tool for data science practitioners. Its data manipulation functions make it a highly accessible and practical tool for aggregating, analyzing, and cleaning data. 

In our blog post on how to learn pandas, we discussed the learning path you may take to master this package. This beginner-friendly tutorial will cover all the basic concepts and illustrate pandas' different functions. You can also check out our course on pandas Foundations for further details. 

This article is aimed at beginners with basic knowledge of Python and no prior experience with pandas to help you get started.

### What is pandas?
pandas is a data manipulation package in Python for tabular data. That is, data in the form of rows and columns, also known as DataFrames. Intuitively, you can think of a DataFrame as an Excel sheet. 

pandasâ€™ functionality includes data transformations, like sorting rows and taking subsets, to calculating summary statistics such as the mean, reshaping DataFrames, and joining DataFrames together. pandas works well with other popular Python data science packages, often called the PyData ecosystem, including

### 1. NumPy for numerical computing
### 2. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other data visualization packages
### 3. scikit-learn for machine learning

## What is pandas used for?
pandas is used throughout the data analysis workflow. With pandas, you can:

Import datasets from databases, spreadsheets, comma-separated values (CSV) files, and more.
Clean datasets, for example, by dealing with missing values.
Tidy datasets by reshaping their structure into a suitable format for analysis.
Aggregate data by calculating summary statistics such as the mean of columns, correlation between them, and more.
Visualize datasets and uncover insights.
pandas also contains functionality for time series analysis and analyzing text data.

### Key benefits of the pandas package
Undoubtedly, pandas is a powerful data manipulation tool packaged with several benefits, including:

Made for Python: Python is the world's most popular language for machine learning and data science.
Less verbose per unit operations: Code written in pandas is less verbose, requiring fewer lines of code to get the desired output. 
Intuitive view of data: pandas offers exceptionally intuitive data representation that facilitates easier data understanding and analysis.
Extensive feature set: It supports an extensive set of operations from exploratory data analysis, dealing with missing values, calculating statistics, visualizing univariate and bivariate data, and much more.
Works with large data: pandas handles large data sets with ease. It offers speed and efficiency while working with datasets of the order of millions of records and hundreds of columns, depending on the machine.
