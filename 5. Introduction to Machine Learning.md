## Introduction to Machine Learning

### 1. What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### 2. Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into three types:

#### 2.1 Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

- **Classification**: Predict categorical labels (e.g., spam detection, image recognition).
- **Regression**: Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).

#### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships within the data.

- **Clustering**: Group similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features while preserving important information (e.g., PCA).

#### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

### 3. Key Concepts in Machine Learning

#### 3.1 Features and Labels
- **Features**: Independent variables or input data used for making predictions.
- **Labels**: Dependent variables or output data used for training in supervised learning.

#### 3.2 Training and Testing Data
- **Training Data**: The subset of data used to train the model.
- **Testing Data**: The subset of data used to evaluate the model's performance.

#### 3.3 Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: The model learns the training data too well, including noise, leading to poor generalization to new data.
- **Underfitting**: The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and new data.

### 4. Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the data relevant to the problem.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate algorithm for the problem.
5. **Training**: Train the model on the training data.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's parameters to improve performance.
8. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

#### 5.1 Supervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised learning can be further divided into several different types, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common types of supervised learning algorithms:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous target variable based on linear relationships between the features.
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

- **Logistic Regression**: Predicts binary outcomes using a logistic function.
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

- **Decision Trees**: Splits data into branches to make predictions based on feature values.
    ```python
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space.
    ```python
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    model = SVC()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Predicts the label based on the majority label of the k-nearest neighbors.
    ```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

#### 5.2 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
    ```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    model.fit(X)
    clusters = model.predict(X)
    ```

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters using a tree structure (dendrogram).
    ```python
    from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
    linked = linkage(X, method='ward')
    dendrogram(linked)
    plt.show()
    ```

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto principal components.
    ```python
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    principal_components = pca.fit_transform(X)
    ```

### 6. Model Evaluation Metrics

#### 6.1 Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to total instances.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
    ```

- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
    precision = precision_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("Precision:", precision)
    ```

- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to total actual positives.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
    recall = recall_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("Recall:", recall)
    ```

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("F1 Score:", f1)
    ```

- **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
    print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
    ```

#### 6.2 Regression Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
    print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
    ```

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
    ```

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the mean squared error.
    ```python
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
    print("Root Mean Squared Error:", rmse)
    ```

- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
    print("R-squared:", r2)
    ```
